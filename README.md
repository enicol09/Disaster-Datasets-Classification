# Disaster-Datasets-Classification

As part of my internship in KIOS, at the excellence center of University of Cyprus
my task was to create an image classifier/segmentation classifier that detects natural disasters
like earhquakes, fires and floods.

The project involved:
1. Gathering the dataset from online pictures.
2. Manually do the labelling
3. Create the segmentation Code.
